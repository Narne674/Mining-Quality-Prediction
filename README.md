# Mining-Quality-Prediction
***Mining Quality Prediction using Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning***
The idea of this personal project is to predict the quality of mining using machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
In this, we will train  the **Artificial Neural Network** model to perform regression tasks. 
Our end goal is to try to understand the theory and intuition behind regression models and train them in Scikit Learn. 
Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.
